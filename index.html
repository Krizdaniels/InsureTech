                    <h3 class="policy__title">House Insurance</h3>
                    <p class="policy_description"> House insurance, also known as homeowners insurance, is a type of insurance policy that provides financial protection against damages to a residential property and its contents. It typically covers damages caused by events such as fire, theft, vandalism, and certain natural disasters like storms or earthquakes, depending on the policy's terms and conditions.

                        House insurance typically consists of several types of coverage:
                        
                        1. **Dwelling Coverage**: This covers damages to the structure of the house itself, including walls, roof, foundation, and attached structures like garages or decks.
                        
                        2. **Personal Property Coverage**: This covers the contents of the house, including furniture, appliances, clothing, and other personal belongings, against theft or damage.
                        
                        3. **Liability Coverage**: This provides protection if someone is injured on your property and you are found legally responsible. It covers medical expenses and legal fees if you're sued.
                        
                        4. **Additional Living Expenses (ALE) Coverage**: This covers the cost of temporary housing and other expenses if your home becomes uninhabitable due to a covered event, such as a fire.
                        
                        The cost of house insurance depends on various factors including the value of the property, location, age of the home, coverage limits, deductible amount, and the insurance provider's underwriting criteria. It's essential to carefully review the policy terms, coverage limits, and exclusions before purchasing house insurance to ensure that it meets your needs and adequately protects your property.</p>
